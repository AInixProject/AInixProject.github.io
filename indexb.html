    had never used Bulma before (it just seemed like a fun new thing to try) 
    but didn't really bother to read the docs, so it was used rather poorly 
    and halfheartedly. In future refactorings more care can be taken in 
    design / framework selection.-->

        <h1 class="title">AInix Kernel</h1>
        <h2 class="subtitle">
          At the core of the AInix (pronounced like "a eye nick's") Project is the AInix 
          Kernel. It is intended to be 
          a user friendly semantic understanding system. 
          Developers can give it a description of a command and some 
          examples, and it then uses machine learning to understand many 
          different phrasings of the command. 
          The current focus is building support for traditional 
          Unix-like commands such as "ls", "grep", and "find". However, The AInix Kernel is 
          intended to in the future just as easily learn commands for things like 
          checking the weather, setting the thermostat, or ordering something 
          online. Additionally it is designed to be
          adaptable enough to eventually support many kinds of user interfaces
          ("shells"), from a command line shell, to a voice assitant, to a 
          video game character.

          axio is a planned communication spec that will work over stdout and
          stdin but allow for rich output (like images, charts, street maps, or
          whole webpages) inline in a shell. It will also focus on being 
          data centric, so that different kinds of shells can present output 
          in different ways. 
          For example, a command line shell, a voice assistent, and a chatbot
          might all choose to present a program 
          outputting something like 
          progress bar event or a calendar date in different ways.
          Concrete work on axio has not yet begun (the plan
          is to start work on it once the AInix Kernel and aish are in a 
          moderately stable place, which might take quite a while)

        Interacting with computers through language is no longer science fiction.
        As these systems become increasingly prevolent and more and more 
        essential to our daily lives, it is important there are open source 
        options. The AInix Project is building a language driven computing
        platform that puts the user first, and hopes to help aid work 
        towards more safe, transparent, and understandable AI.
